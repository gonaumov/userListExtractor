# Extractor of teams channels users by group id

I needed a list of teams channel users and to generate an id 
which looks like this firstName.lastName. I ended with this solution
which I am making open source now. I hope this tiny project to 
help people with similar problems in the future.
In order to use it you need to 
[install the Teams PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-install),
,click with right button of the mouse on userListExtractor.ps1 and choose 
Run with powershell from the context menu. After that the script will 
ask you about your email and the id of the group. 
Enjoy!
